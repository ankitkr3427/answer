Write a python function which accepts a number as an argument and returns True if the number is an Armstrong number



def is_armstrong_number(number):
    # Convert the number to a string to count the number of digits
    num_str = str(number)
    # Count the number of digits in the number
    num_digits = len(num_str)
    # Initialize the sum of digits to 0
    sum_of_digits = 0
    # Iterate through each digit of the number and raise it to the power of the number of digits
    for digit in num_str:
        sum_of_digits += int(digit)**num_digits
    # Check if the sum of the digits is equal to the original number
    if sum_of_digits == number:
        return True
    else:
        return False
Write a Python program which takes email address as input (format : "username@domainname")                                                                                               # Take email address as input
email = input("Enter email address (format: username@domainname): ")

# Print the email address
print("Email address: " + email)
Write a Python program which writes at least three email addresses into a text file emails.txt.                                                                                                                                          # List of email addresses
emails = ["johndoe@gmail.com", "janedoe@yahoo.com", "bobsmith@hotmail.com"]

# Write email addresses to file
with open("emails.txt", "w") as f:
    for email in emails:
        f.write(email + "\n")
Write a Python program which prints all the usernames excluding domain name.
# Read email addresses from file
with open("emails.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        # Split email address at "@" symbol
        username, domain = line.strip().split("@")
        # Print username
        print(username)
